\title{Build a loss matrix}
\usage{
lossMatrix(truthLabels, predLabels, lossValues)

\method{print}{lossMat}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{truthLabels}{character vector of truth labels}

\item{predLabels}{character vector of corresponding predicted labels,
which must be the same length as \code{truthLabels}}

\item{lossValues}{numeric vector of corresponding loss values, which must
be the same length as \code{truthLabels} and \code{predLabels}.}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{lossMat}}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments to \code{print.default}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{lossMat}: a dataframe that contains
all the information of the loss matrix to be used by in calculating the loss.
}
\description{
Build an arbitrary loss matrix for discrete classification
}
\details{
This function checks the inputs and binds the three
arguments columnwise into a dataframe.
}
\examples{

# A 2x2 symmetric loss matrix
lossMatrix(c("a","a","b","b"), c("a","b","a","b"), c(0, 1, 5, 0))

# A 3x2 asymmetric loss matrix
lossMatrix(rep(letters[1:3], each = 2), rep(letters[4:5], 3),
           c(0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0))

# An unbalanced loss matrix with a missing element.
# Not sure why one would want to do this.
lossMatrix(c("a","a","b"), c("a","b","b"), c(0, 1, 0))
